# SlowFormer: Universal Adversarial Patch for Attack on Compute and Energy Efficiency of Inference Efficient Vision Transformers

This Repository is an official implementation of SlowFormer.
Our code is based on [AdaVit](https://github.com/MengLcool/AdaViT), [A-ViT](https://github.com/NVlabs/A-ViT), and [ATS](https://adaptivetokensampling.github.io/). 
## Train Patches

We provide the code for our adversarial patch attack on 3 methods: A-ViT,
AdaViT and ATS. We modify the publicly available codebases for these approaches
to include our attack.

### A-ViT

```sh
cd A-ViT
bash run.sh
```

### ATS

```sh
Soroush Code Here
```

### AdaViT

```sh
cd ada_vit
bash run.sh
```
